/// Allows a view to read its own geometry for use in the construction of its children.
///
/// The layout behavior of this view may be surprising! It behaves *exactly* the same
/// as [`Rectangle`][`crate::view::shape::Rectangle`], which greedily expands to fill
/// all the offered space.
///
/// When proposed a [`Compact`] dimension, such as when used inside a [`ScrollView`] or
/// [`ViewModifier::fixed_size()`] modifier, this view will shrink to only 1 pixel along
/// the compact dimension because it has no "ideal" size.
/// [`GeometryReader`] does not clip its children to its bounds, so when the size
/// is misconfigured, the inner view may unexpectedly overlap other views.
///
/// The contents of the inner view have absolutely no bearing on the frame that
/// [`GeometryReader`] resolves to.
///
/// The [`ViewModifier::frame()`] and [`ViewModifier::flex_frame()`] modifiers are
/// good tools when applied outside the [`GeometryReader`] to control the size of
/// this view when it is presented in a compacting layout.
///
/// If the inner view is larger or smaller than the geometry reader's frame, it will be
/// placed with [`Alignment::TopLeading`] alignment.
///
/// Examples:
///
/// A capsule progress bar which is generic over color and captures.
///
/// This will take on a height of 10 pixels when presented under a [`ScrollView`],
/// but will expand to fill all the available space when used in a non-compacting layout.
